# Byte-Coin
Date: December 2021
Description:
The "ByteCoin" project is a cryptocurrency price tracker that allows users to view the latest exchange rates for different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. This project uses the CoinAPI to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data and display it in a user-friendly interface built using UIKit. It also demonstrates how to make network requests in Swift using URLSession and handle JSON data parsing to display accurate financial data. ByteCoin showcases your ability to work with APIs, manage asynchronous data, and present the information neatly in an iOS app.
